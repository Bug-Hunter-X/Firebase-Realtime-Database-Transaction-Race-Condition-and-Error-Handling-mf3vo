The following code snippet demonstrates a common issue when working with Firebase Realtime Database transactions. The problem arises when attempting to update a value based on its current state without properly handling potential race conditions.  This can lead to unexpected data inconsistencies or lost updates.

```javascript
// Incorrect transaction handling
firebase.database().ref('counter').transaction(function(currentData) {
  if (currentData === null) {
    return 1; // Initialize counter
  } else {
    return currentData + 1; // Increment counter
  }
});
```

The issue here is that multiple concurrent transactions might read the same value and perform the increment independently. Thus, it's not atomic and may miss an increment.

Another problem stems from incorrect error handling. Network issues or security rules could prevent the transaction, which should be accounted for in the code.
