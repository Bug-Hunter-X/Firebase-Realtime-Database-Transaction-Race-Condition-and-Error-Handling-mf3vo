# Firebase Realtime Database Transaction Race Condition and Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common issue and its solution when using Firebase Realtime Database transactions.  The problem arises from concurrent transactions and improper error handling which can lead to data inconsistencies or lost updates. 

## Bug
The `bug.js` file contains code that attempts to increment a counter using a transaction.  However, due to the lack of proper race condition handling, concurrent updates may lead to the counter not being incremented accurately.  There is also a lack of proper error handling, making the transaction unreliable.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected implementation. The solution addresses the race condition by using an atomic operation that ensures the counter is incremented correctly, regardless of concurrent updates.   It also includes robust error handling to manage potential network issues or security rule violations.
